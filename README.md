# Beat the Hackers
Password Generator
-
My first repository on GitHub. For those who care about security on the web. Create strong passwords for your accounts.
Run the code on python 3+ and generate your password.
The characters are randomized and you can choose the length of the password. It includes upper and lowercase, symbols and numbers.

Suggestions:
-
~ don't use the same password for multiple accounts
~ don't include personal information in your passwords
~ don't store your passwords on WebBrowsers
~ don't log in to sensitive accounts on others' computers, or when you're connected to a public WiFi, web proxy, Tor, free VPN
~ don't send sensitive information via unecrypted connections (HTTP, FTP). Use encrypted connections (HTTPS, FTP) whenever possible
~ do turn on 2-Factor-Authentication whenever possible
~ passwords should be at least 16 characters long
~ do use combinations of upper and lowercase, symbols and numbers
~ if you want to use a word or a phrase do mispell it by changing letters to numbers and symbles: "I am hungry" --> "1@m#Un8Ry!"
~ do change your passwords regularly
~ do log out from your accounts when you're finished using them
